## Cancer Transcriptomics Dataset Analysis

Authors: Daniel Esguerra, Kaleemuddin Mohammed, Reethigha Uruthiran, Siddhi Naik

### **1. Introduction**

**Field Overview:** The dataset originates from the field of cancer transcriptomics, a branch of molecular biology that studies gene expression through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in cancer cells. Transcriptomics provides insight into how genes are regulated in various conditions, such as disease progression or drug response.

In cancer research, patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have emerged as a promising model system. PDOs are three-dimensional cultures grown from tumor cells, maintaining the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the patient’s tumor. In the case of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), transcriptomics can reveal changes in gene expression that occur during culture and treatment, providing potential targets for precision medicine [Chen H., et al., 2020; Nero C., et al., 2021; Maenhoudt N., et al., 2020]. 

**Dataset Context:** The dataset focuses on RNA sequencing of PDOs derived from malignant effusions of HGSOC patients. These effusions are fluid accumulations that often contain chemotherapy-resistant multicellular spheroids. By studying gene expression changes at two time points (Day 0 and Day 6 of short-term culture), we aim to uncover adaptive mechanisms of the tumour cells, transitioning from in vivo environments to ex vivo conditions as well as potential biomarkers for drug resistance. Previous studies, such as Chen H., et al. (2020), have shown that short-term organoid cultures from HGSOC malignant effusions exhibit upregulation of proliferation-related genes, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, and KRAS signaling pathways, providing insights into drug resistance mechanisms [Chen H., et al., 2020].

### **2. Research Question and Hypothesis**

How does the gene expression profile change between Day 0 and Day 6 in HGSOC organoids?

-   **Hypothesis:** Transcriptomic profiles at Day 6 will show significant changes in stress response and metabolic pathways due to culture conditions.
-   **Prediction:** Genes associated with cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism will be upregulated.

### **3. Data Description**

#### **3.1 Dataset Overview**

The dataset consists of RNA-seq read counts from four HGSOC patient-derived organoids, with samples collected at two time points (Day 0 and Day 6). Each file includes three columns: Ensembl gene IDs, gene names, and RNA-seq read counts.

**Files Provided:**

-   A778_D0.tsv, A778_D6.tsv
-   A820_D0.tsv, A820_D6.tsv
-   A870_D0.tsv, A870_D6.tsv
-   A899_D0.tsv, A899_D6.tsv

#### **3.2 Data Wrangling and Exploratory Code**

**Data Preprocessing Steps:** 

-   Loaded the data using tidyverse’s readr package.
-   Checked for missing values.
-   Normalized read counts using the DESeq2 package.
-   Filtered low-expression, outlier genes, and ambiguous reads to improve statistical power.
-   Merged samples from the same patient for comparative analysis.

**Data Characteristics:**

-   Each file contains 58,725 rows representing genes and three columns.
-   Gene expression varies between Day 0 and Day 6, reflecting biological changes during culture.

```{r data_processing, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(DESeq2)

# Update file paths as needed
file_paths <- list.files(path = "1_CancerTranscriptomics/read_counts", 
                         pattern = "*.tsv", full.names = TRUE)
data_list <- lapply(file_paths, function(file) {
  read_tsv(file, col_names = c("Ensembl_ID", "Gene_Name", "Read_Counts"))
})

# Assigns names to datasets for clarity
names(data_list) <- c("A778_D0", "A778_D6", "A820_D0", "A820_D6", 
                      "A870_D0", "A870_D6", "A899_D0", "A899_D6")

## Inspecting the data ##

# View structure and sample content of one file
str(data_list[[1]])
head(data_list[[1]])
lapply(data_list, dim) # Loops dim to check the individual files' dimensions

# Adding sample and timepoint metadata
for (i in seq_along(data_list)) {
  sample_info <- str_split(names(data_list)[i], "_", simplify = TRUE) 
  # takes the sample name and timepoint and splits them
  data_list[[i]] <- data_list[[i]] %>%
    mutate(Sample = sample_info[1],
           Time = sample_info[2])
}
```

```{r data_summary, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## Combining the 8 files into 1 merged dataset ##
merged_data <- bind_rows(data_list)
head(merged_data)

# Summary of read counts
str(merged_data)

# Remove unwanted ambiguous rows
cleaned_data <- merged_data %>%
  filter(!grepl("^_", Ensembl_ID))  

# Check results
head(cleaned_data)

# Check for missing or zero values
summary(cleaned_data$Read_Counts)
table(cleaned_data$Read_Counts == 0)  # Count zero values

# Inspect the range of Read_Counts
range(cleaned_data$Read_Counts, na.rm = TRUE)
quantile(cleaned_data$Read_Counts, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.05), na.rm = TRUE) 

# Check summary after initial filtering
summary(cleaned_data$Read_Counts)
```

This initial exploration helped in deciding appropriate filtering thresholds before applying DESeq2 normalization, as well as further visualization of the data. This allowed us to understand the structure further, as well as detect potential issues that have to be processed. This initial step will ensure that downstream differential expression analysis produces biologically meaningful results while mitigating bias introduced by outliers or technical artifacts.

**Exploratory Analysis:**

-   Summary statistics of read counts (mean, median, range).
-   Histogram and boxplot visualizations to check the distribution of the values.
-   PCA analysis was used to visualize and explore the data structure of the high-dimensional dataset to identify potential relationships, batch effects and any outliers.
-   Initial DESeq2 processing, including normalization and creation of a DESeqDataset for further downstream analyses.

### **4. Approach to Answering Research Questions**

#### **Steps and Methodology:**

1.  **Preprocessing:**
    -   Normalized raw read counts using a method like DESeq2 median-ratio and rlog transformation after filtering low-expressed genes.
2.  **Differential Expression Analysis:**
    -   Compare Day 0 and Day 6 samples for significantly up- or downregulated genes using DESeq2 or edgeR.
    -   Identify enriched pathways related to cell survival, proliferation and metabolism to assess stress response.
3.  **Functional Enrichment and Pathway Analysis:**
    -   Use Enrichr or DAVID to identify differentially expressed genes linked to stress response and cell proliferation.
    -   May also try Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to detect broader pathway-level shifts to check for enrichment trends across the transcriptome.
4.  **Visualization and Interpretation:**
    -   Generate heatmaps for visualizing patterns of gene expression changes across samples.
    -   Perform t-SNE and UMAP for sample clustering and condense high-dimensionality data into a more digestible format while preserving local and global structures.

### **5. Anticipated Roadblocks and Solutions**

**High Variability in Gene Expression Across Samples:**

Individual patient samples may exhibit variability due to differences in tumor microenvironment, genetic background, or prior treatment history.

-   Solutions:
    -   We can apply **log-transformation (log2(counts +1))** before visualization to quickly check.
    -   Can also use **DESeq2 normalization** to account for sequencing depth differences.
    -   Filtering out **lowly expressed genes** to improve statistical power.

**Batch Effects & Technical Variability:**

Samples from different patients may have batch effects due to variations in sequencing runs or sample preparation.

-   Solutions:
    -   To solve this, we can perform **PCA analysis** to identify batch effects.

    -   We can also use **Combat-Seq** (sva) or **RemoveBatchEffect** (limma) if needed, for preservation of biological differences and when handling log-transformed expression values.

**Small Sample Size & Low Statistical Power**

Given that we only have 4 sets of patient-derived organoids, with 8 samples overall, the statistical power for detecting differentially expressed genes may be somewhat low, leading to high false discovery rates or a failure to detect more subtle, yet biologically relevant changes that would otherwise be seen in a larger dataset.

-   Solutions:
    -   In an effort to solve this, paired differential expression may be used to account for individual differences in the data and increase statistical power

    -   Gene Set Enrichment Analysis can also be conducted to aggregate data into gene sets, rather than focusing on individual genes.

**Difficulty in Detecting Chemotherapy Resistance Markers**

One of the most common use cases of HGSOCs are for identifying chemotherapy resistance markers in patients. However, these mechanisms, like that with stress response and cell survival, typically involve multiple genes working in conjunction as well as pathways. As such, transient changes in stress response genes may not reflect long-term chemotherapy resistance.

-   Solutions:
    -   Usage of pathway-level analysis instead of focusing on individual genes or markers.

    -   Comparison of the results with public HGSOC datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), as these are likely to have larger patient cohorts and thus viable for benchmarking purposes.
